# Data Mining and Machine Learning Project

In this project, we used the techniques learned throughout the data mining and machine learning courses and applied them to the Hotel dataset. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). The dataset has 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking. Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining hotel or costumer identification were deleted.
